Anomalous Expansion of Water: 
It is a collaborative project where we created an interactive simulation that shows how heat transfer works in water bodies. The anomalous property of water getting less dense below 4 degrees Celsius is also shown. You can change the temperature and switch between three views:
Default: just the water body;
Particles: you can see the water particles and how they behave;
Layers: you can see the layers of water and how they move around to transfer heat;
